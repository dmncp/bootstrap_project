            <h2 class="text-center">Functions and side effects</h2>
            <p>
                Functions can be roughly divided into those that are called for their side effects
                and those that are called for their return value. (Though it is definitely also
                possible to both have side effects and return a value.)
                The first helper function in the farm example, printZeroPaddedWithLabel,
                is called for its side effect: it prints a line. The second version, zeroPad, is
                called for its return value. It is no coincidence that the second is useful in more
                situations than the first. Functions that create values are easier to combine in
                new ways than functions that directly perform side effects.
                A pure function is a specific kind of value-producing function that not only
                has no side effects but also doesn’t rely on side effects from other code—for
                example, it doesn’t read global bindings whose value might change. A pure
                function has the pleasant property that, when called with the same arguments,
                it always produces the same value (and doesn’t do anything else). A call to
                such a function can be substituted by its return value without changing the
                meaning of the code. When you are not sure that a pure function is working
                correctly, you can test it by simply calling it and know that if it works in that
                context, it will work in any context. Nonpure functions tend to require more
                scaffolding to test.
                Still, there’s no need to feel bad when writing functions that are not pure or
                to wage a holy war to purge them from your code. Side effects are often useful.
                There’d be no way to write a pure version of console.log, for example, and
                console.log is good to have. Some operations are also easier to express in an
                efficient way when we use side effects, so computing speed can be a reason to
                avoid purity.
